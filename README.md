A typing game where your power scales with wpm (words per minute).


TODO: 
1. fix healthbar numbers

bugs:
1. wpm goes into the negative when you type the wrong words

ideas: 
1. Some words are orange or yellow and the letters in the words spawn a fireball-like projectile and also does some crazy effects type shit. If the whole word gets typed out correctly, an animation happens and the player gets a +0.5% rocket damage increase for 10 seconds.
