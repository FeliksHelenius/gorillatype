A typing game where your power scales with wpm (words per minute).

TODO:

1. fix healthbar numbers DONE
2. fix responsiveness DONE
3. different type of projectiles DONE
4. rockets should change name to projectiles DONE
5. a damage notifier
6.

bugs:

1. wpm goes into the negative when you type the wrong words

ideas:

1. Some words are orange or yellow and the letters in the words spawn a fireball-like projectile and also does some crazy effects type shit. If the whole word gets typed out correctly, an animation happens and the player gets a +0.5% rocket damage increase for 10 seconds.
